`aq calcs x`: reduces x and returns up to 30 random equivalents

`aq lookup x`: x must be a whole number. returns up to 30 equivalents for x

`aq roll`: gets 2 random symbols for divination or whatever. The 2 results represent a transition from the first phase to the second, similar to the I-Ching's changing lines. The first result is more pertinent + detailed and the 2nd is contextual backdrop."""
