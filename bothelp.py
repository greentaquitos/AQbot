`aq calcs x`: reduces x and returns up to 30 random equivalents

`aq lookup x`: x must be a whole number. returns up to 30 equivalents for x

`aq roll`: gets 2 random phrases for divination or whatever. The 2 results represent a transition from the first phase to the second, similar to the I-Ching's changing lines. The first result is more pertinent + detailed and the 2nd is contextual backdrop.

`aq pull [flag] [x]`: flag and x are both optional. flag can be p or g. x must be a whole number. pulls x 'cards' from a mix of your personal symbols and the global symbols curated by taq. Use the p flag to only pull from the former and the g flag to only pull from the latter.

`aq feed x`: x can be a single symbol or a comma-separated list of symbols to add to your personal set of symbols for use with the pull command."""
